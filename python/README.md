This directory contains python modules to integrate radio astronomy spectral line observations. This code
is used to perform astronomical observations within the Gnuradio Companion (GRC) environment.

ra_vave.py - radio astronomy vector averaging with decimation

ra_vmedian.py - radio astronomy vector medianing with decimation

ra_vevent.py - radio astronomy event detection; input I/Q samples, output vector

ra_integrate.py - radio astronomy diagnostic tool for plotting raw or calibrated radio spectra

ra_ascii_sink.py - radio astronomy tool for writing ascii spectra with observational parameters recorded.

radioastronomy.py - utilities for reading, writing and calibrating radio astronomical observations

jdutil.py - local copy of "Julian Date Utilities", with modifications for direct calculation of Modified Julian Date.

angles.py - utilities for computing angular conversions.
